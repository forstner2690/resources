## Führerschein

## Skillvestor:

- Nur für mich, nur Companies.
- Nur 1 Django page: List of companies + One Rating +  Filter to filter based on this one rating
- Da filter ich mal alle Companies mit > 80!

´´´
Use websearch to create an insitutional level equity research report for the company {company}.
Focus on the following questions:

- Is the company in a strong financial position?
- Does and will the company perform well?
- Is the debt situation problematic or easy to manage?
- Is the company in a good position vs. competitors and in the context of the overall economic conditions?
- Will the company perform well currently, in the near future (6-12 months) and long-term (3+ years).

At the end rate the company from 1 to 100 (1=strong sell, 100=strong buy). **NEVER COPY ANALYST RATINGS! DO THE RATING BASED ON YOU OWN CONCLUSIONS!**
Provide a holistic and comprehensive rationale for you rating.
