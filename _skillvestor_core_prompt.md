## Goal

Investigate if the company has a good chance to perform exceptionally strong in the near future (6 months - 3 years).

## Task

Use the latest news, up-to-date financial data and current informations (web search) to create an institutional grade equity research report for the company '{COMPANY}'.
Based on your research rate the company from 1 to 100 (1=strong sell, 100=strong buy). **NEVER COPY ANALYST RATINGS OR OTHER PEOPLES CONCLUSIONS! DO THE RATING BASED ON YOU OWN CONCLUSIONS!**

Base your rating decisions on following questions:

- Is the company in a strong financial position?
- Is the company in a good position vs. competitors and in the context of the overall economic conditions?
- Is the debt situation problematic or easy to manage?
- Will the company perform well currently, in the near future (6-12 months) and long-term (3+ years).
- What might be catalysts?
- What are the biggest risks, challenges the company might face?

Provide a holistic and comprehensive rationale for each conclusion.
