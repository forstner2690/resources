## Goal

Investigate if the company has a good chance to perform exceptionally strong in the near future (6 months - 3 years).

## Task

Use the latest news, up-to-date financial data and current informations (web search) to create an institutional grade equity research report for the company '{COMPANY}'.

Based on your research create a 3 point rating of the company:

- Valuation (1 - 100; 1=strongly overvalued, 100=strongly undervalued)
- Recommendation (1 - 100; 1=strong sell, 100=strong buy).
- Expected performance (1 - 100; 1=very weak, 100=very strong)

**NEVER COPY ANALYST RATINGS OR OTHER PEOPLES CONCLUSIONS! DO THE RATING BASED ON YOU OWN CONCLUSIONS!**

Base your rating decisions on following questions:

- Is the valuation of the company reasonable, overvalued or undervalued?
- Is the company in a strong financial position?
- Is the company in a good position vs. competitors and in the context of the overall economic conditions?
- Is the debt situation problematic or easy to manage?
- Will the company perform well currently, in the near future (6-12 months) and long-term (3+ years).
- What might be catalysts?
- What are the biggest risks, challenges the company might face?

Think about each question in a holistic and comprehensive way and provide a clear rationale for each decision.
