## Context
We want to find exceptional investment opportunities. 

## Goal
Use latest news, up-to-date financial data and current informations (web search) to create an institutional grade equity research report for the company '{COMPANY}'.

## Rating
Based on your research rate the company from 1 to 100 (1=strong sell, 100=strong buy). **NEVER COPY ANALYST RATINGS! DO THE RATING BASED ON YOU OWN CONCLUSIONS!**

Base your rating decisions based on following questions:

- Is the company in a strong financial position?
- Does and will the company perform well?
- Is the debt situation problematic or easy to manage?
- Is the company in a good position vs. competitors and in the context of the overall economic conditions?
- Will the company perform well currently, in the near future (6-12 months) and long-term (3+ years).

Provide a holistic and comprehensive rationale for each conclusion.
